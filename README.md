### I write code for myself, my family, and very occasionally for causes I feel worthwhile, like inclusivity in music education, _to name one and seulement one._ I know I'm already _wasting your time_ ;)  

## [Coding is Political.](https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc_2e/)[^1]

#### I write code that _saves me time_ in my quotidian  
_e.g.,_ and wholeheartedly **not**, _i.e.[^1]_, as a mathematics tutor, manual trigonometry to check student work is annoying.  
Unless you've had to manually adjust quadrants hundreds of times in the last 3 years after pulling an arctangent, don't @ me.  
If you have, I would hope this could make your life easier too:  https://protract.ing   
^ I made that site as a first 'learners site' with somewhat involved `scripting things` going on; and it is literally a tool to save *me and only me time*. If it helps somewhere someone else somewhere, that's great but I can't be bothered to check in. Basically I mean to say the site is really ugly and is not responsive or reactive or stateful or any buzzword-salad-nonsense, and, most importantly, will potentially never see a push to *trunk again.  
So by means of convolution, sometimes, going back to basics, like barebones html & css is perfectly fine; I say applaud it, but don't plug your ears lol ;)

### I agree that code is _Craft_; the desktop workstation an atelier; not a newfnagled teletype[^1]
##### and I do not claim credit for that conception, right? *It was, once upon a time, a movement*. I learned of it by starting to explore the works of sociologist Richard Sennet.


I believe in **FOSS wholeheartedly**, and I mean **wholeheartedly**...  
...wholeheartedly.  

#### I have strong opinions about large language models, indentation, and aligning `=` and `::`, `/etc/`[^1]; not that it matters[^2]

### **Current Goals (Educational or Otherwise Educative):**
* Learn Fortran
  * So I can contribute to CMAQ
  * and be less unserious
    * I'm logging this process in my FortranGoingOnForty github organization
      * I recognize that ^ gives way more gravity[^3] to my lil projects than they or I deserve. Remember though, *indirection everywhere*, even in your source code, but sometimes (a lot of the (most of the ) (of times)) that's a good thing! Most of the time!  
* Use Fortran in a WebAssembly toolchain so I *__own__* my DAW that I have been 'writing' (it's more of a frankenDAW, borrowing but not yet lending from other libraries) for thesis
  * convolution
  * threading with Fortran OpenMP directives (if they're different from C standard OpenMP directives - I'm green in this regard (the fortran regard...well I guess most regards; not tryna misrepresent))
  * See what I can incorporate into DigitalDipole if I figure out the WA.
* Refactor my repos into related GH orgs
* Continue to not push my solutions to school PAs to public GH repos and call them 'projects' as if personally, _unlike some._
 * y'all. Idk, I just don't really have words. Think about all the scaffolding for you to have the opportunity to write that project?
   * it's just sad, really. 
* Get back into obfuscated C[^1] ^^ ;)
* Alluded to above, but for my thesis I have been working towards building a digital audio workstation in the browser (scaffolded within a research project at JMU); I want every last line in my DAW to either by my own or FOSS.
* Never finish anything  
* Get better at bash scripting (that's a daemon)

### I like French film:

## I take myself wholly unseriously; I'm just here to tinker[^1].

[^1]: _Sapient sat._
[^2]: _It matters._
[^3]: _Bit dramatic with the word choice; and it breaks the flow too :: 'credence' and a myriad other words fit better. But I'm trying to make gravity happen (more than it happens now at least) to evince a situation with **(see)** : weight[^4]._
nota bene; *if you're a person who is for some reason reading this, and who appreciates ...subtleties? Maybe is a word... check the commits on this readme?*
[^4]: (noun) : that force which reminds one that gravity is still in charge.
