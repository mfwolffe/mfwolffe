### I write code for myself, my family, and for causes I feel worthy, like inclusivity in music education, _to name one and seulement one._ I know I'm already _wasting your time_ ;)  

### [Coding is Political.](https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc_2e/)[^1]

#### I write code that _saves me time_ in my quotidian  
_e.g.,_ and wholeheartedly **not** _i.e.[^1]_, as a mathematics tutor, manual trigonometry to check student work is annoying.  
Unless you've had to manually adjust quadrants hundreds of times in the last 3 years after pulling an arctangent, don't @ me.  
If you have, I would hope this could make your life easier too:  https://protract.ing   
^ don't get it twisted; I made that site as a first 'learners site' with somewhat involved `scripting things` going on; and it is literally a tool to save *me and only me time*. If it helps someone else somewhere sometime that's great but I can't be bothered to check in.   

#### I believe code is _Craft_; the desktop workstation an atelier; not a newfnagled teletype[^1]
##### and I do not claim credit for that conception, right? *It was, once upon a time, a movement*. I learned of it by starting to explore the works of sociologist Richard Sennet.


I believe in **FOSS wholeheartedly**, and I mean **wholeheartedly**...  
...wholeheartedly.  

#### I have strong opinions about large language models, indentation, and aligning `=` and `::` and `/etc/`[^1], not that it matters[^2]

### **Current Goals (Educational or Otherwise Educative):**
* Learn Fortran
  * So I can contribute to CMAQ
  * and be less unserious
    * I'm logging this process in my FortranGoingOnForty github organization
* Use Fortran in a WebAssembly toolchain so I *_own_* my DAW that I have been writing for [MusicCPR](musiccpr.org)
  * convolution
  * threading with Fortran OpenMP directives (if they're different from C standard OpenMP directives - I'm green in this regard (the fortran regard))
* Refactor my repos into related GH orgs
* Continue to not push my solutions to school PAs to public GH repos and call them 'projects' as if personally, _unlike some._ 
* Get back into obfuscated C[^1] ^^ ;)
* Alluded to above, but for my thesis I have been working towards building a digital audio workstation in the browser (scaffolded within MusicCPR); I want every last line in my DAW to either by my own or FOSS.

> he likes Linux and Unix history and all things FOSS.  
> he doesn't like Microsoft Office, but he'll use it when cornered.  
> he doesn't like indentation or competing standards, but does like POSIX for the most part <3.  
> he likes shells and keybinds and symlinks.  
> Walking his dog Moby at sunrise, but he's diametrically opposed to waking up earlier than 6:30.  
> he does like daylight savings, but only periodically[^1].  
> he likes a minimum of six car lengths on I-81, though he rarely even gets thrown a bone of one[^1].  
> he dislikes the distillation of nuance and the erasure of historical asides.  
> he's liked writing scripts since age 11,  
> and 'disliked’ writing `code` since age 12.  
> et, apres (yeah yeah I know you just hold down a key[^1], but I use arch btw ;))

### I take myself wholly unseriously; I'm just here to tinker[^1].
#### if you read this and come to the conculsion I do the opposite, then what is wrong with you lol
